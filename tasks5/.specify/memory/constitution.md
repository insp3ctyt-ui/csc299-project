# CSC299 Task Manager Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Python CLI
The project must be a command-line application written in Python.

### II. Single File Portability
The application logic must be contained in a single Python file. It must be portable and self-contained.

### III. JSON Database
All data must be stored in a single JSON file named `data.json` located at the project root. No external databases are allowed.

### IV. Code Clarity
The code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand.

## Development Workflow
The AI will implement features requested by the user. The primary features are `add`, `list`, `done`, and `delete`.
